## Connecting the Processor to the Computer
 
To connect the DS48 processor to the computer, you will need a DB-9 type serial cable, which is included with the unit. If your computer only has USB ports, adapters are available from computer suppliers. Connect one end of the cable to the RS-232 port on the back of the processor, and the other end to a serial port on your computer[^1^] [^2^].
 
## Navigating the Software
 
To start up the Bbe Sysomax software, you can either use the Start menu on your Windows desktop, or use Windows Explorer or My Computer to navigate to the folder in which SYSOMAX resides, then double-click the SYSOMAX.exe icon[^1^] [^3^].
 
Once you have started the program, you can choose to either operate the program online or offline to the unit. To operate online, you need to connect the cable between the unit and the computer. To operate offline, you can create and edit programs without connecting to the unit. Always remember to save your programs. To upload or download programs to or from the unit, you need to use the Transfer menu[^1^] [^3^].
 
The main window of the software consists of four sections: Menu Bar, Toolbar, Program Window, and Status Bar. The Menu Bar contains commands for file operations, editing functions, device settings, and help topics. The Toolbar contains buttons for quick access to some of these commands. The Program Window displays a graphical representation of the signal flow and parameters of each channel. The Status Bar shows information about the current program and device status[^1^] [^3^].
