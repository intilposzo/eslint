# Navisworks Manage: A Powerful Tool for BIM Coordination and Clash Detection
 
Navisworks Manage is a software product from Autodesk that enables project teams to review and coordinate 3D models from various disciplines and sources. Navisworks Manage helps improve BIM (Building Information Modeling) project delivery by allowing users to visualize and unify design and construction data within a single federated model, identify and resolve clash and interference problems before construction begins, and control schedules and costs using 4D and 5D simulation.
 
## What are the benefits of using Navisworks Manage?
 
Navisworks Manage offers several advantages for project stakeholders, such as:

- Reducing errors, rework, and delays by detecting and resolving clashes early in the design process.
- Enhancing communication and collaboration among team members by providing a common platform for viewing, commenting, and sharing model data.
- Supporting decision making and risk management by simulating various scenarios and outcomes using time, cost, and material data.
- Integrating with other Autodesk products and cloud services, such as Revit, AutoCAD, BIM 360, and Autodesk Construction Cloud, to streamline workflows and data exchange.

## How to get started with Navisworks Manage?
 
If you are interested in trying out Navisworks Manage, you can download a free 30-day trial from the Autodesk website[^1^]. You can also access Navisworks Manage as part of the Architecture, Engineering & Construction Collection, which includes other BIM tools such as Revit, AutoCAD, Civil 3D, InfraWorks, and more[^2^]. To learn more about Navisworks Manage features and capabilities, you can visit the Autodesk website[^3^] or watch some tutorials on YouTube.
  
## What are the main features of Navisworks Manage?
 
Navisworks Manage has a range of features that enable users to review and coordinate 3D models effectively. Some of the main features are:

- Model aggregation: Navisworks Manage can import and combine models from various file formats and sources, such as Revit, AutoCAD, SketchUp, IFC, DGN, and more. Users can also create links between models to maintain data consistency and update changes automatically.
- Clash detection: Navisworks Manage can perform clash tests between different model elements, such as geometry, clearance, or time. Users can customize the clash rules, tolerance, and reporting options to suit their project needs. Users can also assign and track clash issues using the Autodesk Construction Cloud integration.
- 4D and 5D simulation: Navisworks Manage can create 4D simulations by linking model objects to project schedules from external applications, such as Microsoft Project or Primavera. Users can animate and interact with the model objects to visualize the construction sequence and identify potential conflicts or delays. Users can also create 5D simulations by adding cost data to the model objects and generating cash flow reports.
