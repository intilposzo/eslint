- If you bought Adobe After Effects CC from the Adobe website or an authorized reseller, you should have received an email with your serial number. Check your inbox and spam folder for an email from Adobe with the subject line "Your Serial Number" or "Your Product Registration Info". If you can't find the email, you can also log in to your Adobe account and go to [https://account.adobe.com/products](https://account.adobe.com/products) to view your registered products and serial numbers.
- If you bought Adobe After Effects CC as part of a Creative Cloud subscription, you don't need a serial number. You just need to sign in with your Adobe ID and password to activate your product. You can also manage your subscription and download the latest version of Adobe After Effects CC from the Creative Cloud desktop app or the [https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps](https://creativecloud.adobe.com/apps) website.
- If you downloaded Adobe After Effects CC from a torrent or a crack website, you are using an illegal and unlicensed version of the product. This means that you won't be able to access the full features and updates of Adobe After Effects CC, and you may also expose your computer to viruses and malware. We strongly recommend that you uninstall this version and purchase a legitimate copy of Adobe After Effects CC from the official website or an authorized reseller.
