Enya was born Eithne NÃ­ BhraonÃ¡in in 1961 in Gweedore, County Donegal, Ireland. She grew up in a musical family and joined the Irish folk group Clannad, which was formed by her siblings and uncles. She left the group in 1982 to pursue a solo career and collaborated with producer and manager Nicky Ryan and his wife, lyricist Roma Ryan. Together, they developed Enya's distinctive sound, which involves layering multiple tracks of Enya's voice, keyboards, and instruments.
 
Enya's first solo album, Enya (1987), was a soundtrack for the BBC documentary series The Celts. It received little attention at the time, but was re-released in 1992 as The Celts and gained more recognition. Her second album, Watermark (1988), was a breakthrough success, thanks to the hit single Orinoco Flow, which topped the charts in several countries. Enya followed this with Shepherd Moons (1991), which won her first Grammy Award for Best New Age Album.
 
Enya continued to release successful albums throughout the 1990s and 2000s, such as The Memory Of Trees (1995), A Day Without Rain (2000), Amarantine (2005), and And Winter Came... (2008). She also contributed to several film soundtracks, such as The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring (2001), The Age Of Innocence (1993), and L.A. Story (1991). She has sold over 80 million records worldwide and is one of the best-selling artists of all time.
